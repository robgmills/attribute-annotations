# The Attribution Annotations
We've noticed that there's not really a good way to cite code snippets gleaned
from the various developer blogs, tutorials, presentations, and what-have-yous.
The code contained in this project is to help us as developers, properly
attribute where we get code "*snippets*" from.

Let's face it, as developers, we borrow, copy, and sometimes flat out steal
(shame on you!) code to help us do our job better and/or faster.  They say,
"Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery." (Charles Caleb Colton, *Lacon,
or, Many things in few words, 1820*)  Or, "'Good artists copy, great artists
steal' - Pablo Picasso". (Steve Jobs)  There's nothing wrong with finding
inspiration in another's work.

Sometimes this is a good thing, as in the case when someone has written
something so cleanly and concisely that there's just not a better way to do it.

Sometimes this is a bad thing, as in when you've copied something so bad that
you have no idea how it works, but it does, and you're moving on.

Sometimes it simply serves as a reminder to go back and better understand what
is happening.

But no matter the case, give credit where credit is due.

# Change Log
## 1.0
The initial release.  Contains just the basics: `@Attribution` and `@Stolen`.

# Roadmap
Honestly, there isn't much more to this.  There probably won't be many changes
in the future.  However, I *do* plan to search for usage of the annotations
contained in this project using the
[GitHub Search API](https://developer.github.com/v3/search/#search-code) and
publish the top attributions in the pages of this project.  So expect to see
little changes to the annotations themselves, but fun stuff built around them.
